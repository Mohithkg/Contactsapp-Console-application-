This work was centered on the design and implementation of a Contacts app. The 
study traced the contacts list to store the name and contact number of a person 
using the Linked list. This project work also focused primarily on storing contact 
data of person. Interestingly, in the end we store the contact details in the CSV file 
and separate the data of person. Therefore, this project will help immensely in the 
following way. Easy storing the data of contact person to the list ,easy to delete the 
contact from the list ,easy to search the contact in the list.

As per the source code ,

First we create a node with the contact information of first name, last name and mobile 
number of person.
• create_file from this function we create the file in csv format to insert the 
information clearly using the file concepts.
• After that ,we create the header node as start to point the node to the getnode to 
store the contact information in the getnode. 
• We use the insert function to check the file is created or not ,if file is created we can 
insert the contact information to the node and same will be copied to file.
• A search function is implemented with Linear search Technique.
• Function del() is used to delete The Contact nodes in linked list by using free 
function.
